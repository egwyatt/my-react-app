As a cook, I want to add a, "Buy tomatoes" Todo to the Todo list so that I can remember to buy tomatoes. 
As an event planner, I want to strike through the completed Todo, "get wedding cake", so that I can keep track of all the Todos I have left uncompleted in prepartaion for a wedding I'm planing.
As a busy mom I want to delete a todo so that I will be rid of a Todo that I no longer need to keep track of.
